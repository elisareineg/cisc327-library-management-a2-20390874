# Summary of Test Cases

## R1

## R2

## R3

### Test Patron ID Length & Alphanumeric
    - Displays an AssertionError if the length of the patron ID is invalid or it contains non-digits: "Invalid patron ID. Must be exactly 6 digits."
### Book Availability
    - Displays an AssertionError with "You have reached the maximum borrowing limit of 5 books."
## Borrowing Record
    - Displays a failure with "'already borrowed' in 'this book is currently not available.'"

## R4
 - The return book interface and functionality is missing, however, there are still hypothetical test cases to be made for if the functionality were working.
 - I've included specific test cases, as well as explanations and expected output of each function within the requirements for return book, along with my assumptions.
